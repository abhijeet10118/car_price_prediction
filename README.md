# car_price_prediction
This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on their features.  It uses a dataset of used car listings from India and a Linear Regression model to estimate the car's value. The entire data cleaning and modeling process is bundled into a scikit-learn Pipeline, which automates preprocessing and prediction.
